# HoltWintersForcasting-Python

 Holt-Winters (HW) time series method is used to produce short-term demand forecasts when salesdata contain a trend and a seasonal pattern.
 
- Trend : long-term increase in the data due the increase in number of
active Smart TVs
- Seasonality: data is influenced by seasonal factors over a fixed period of
time (e.g. the impressions increase on weekend and fall over weekdays)
 
 For implementation in Python,  the Forcast pakage from R is imported using rpy2 package.
